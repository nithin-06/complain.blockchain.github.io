The main objective of this project is to serve the common citizens, an easy and effective way of filing a complaint to the police online through a website.
This way of filing the complaint is anonymous since only the Aadhar number is needed to be given by the victim. Through this any individual can express their situation to the higher official without any fear. Thus the most important purpose of the project is to make easy for the common people to file a complaint without even coming to the police station which will avoid discrimination of people based of caste or religion by the policemen if they come in-person to the police station and find solution for their case by directly taking them to the concern of the higher officials.
